                <p><b>Q: Are your products 100% manufactured&nbsp;by Boosted?</b></p>
                <p>A: Yup, we acquired everything that Boosted had, and it came direct from them.&nbsp;</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Q: What if something says out of stock?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We are absolutely not permitted to create new products for / by Boosted because their IP was sold off. We can only sell the rest of the stock that we have. Supplies are extremely limited, this is the last of Boosted's stock&nbsp;and when it's gone it's gone forever. Once something says sold out, that is it, you will not be able to get it&nbsp;again.&nbsp;</p>    
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Q:&nbsp;Who pays for shipping?</strong></p>
                <p>USA answer:&nbsp;We will pay for shipping on anything over $100.&nbsp;If you need something repaired you will be required to pay for shipping both ways.&nbsp;If your board requires a warranty part&nbsp;we will do our best to ship you a replacement part on us to get you back up and rolling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Canadian answer: Please see <a href="https://boostedusa.com/pages/shipping">shipping page</a></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Q: Where are you located, can I come in for a visit?</strong></p>
            <p>A:&nbsp; We are located in&nbsp;San Francisco, CA&nbsp;and are not open to the public.&nbsp;</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Q: I am a retailer and am desperate for more Boosted products.&nbsp; Can you hook me up?</strong></p>
            <p>A: Send us an email: <a href="mailto:support@boostedusa.com">support@boostedusa.com</a></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><b>Q: I am international, specifically&nbsp;Canada.&nbsp; Can I buy from you?</b></p>
                <p>A: We are now shipping to Canada! We are actively trying to go more international, please keep an eye on our instagram @boosted_usa to stay up to date on announcements.</p>    
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Q: I am going to use a freight forwarder. What happens if they can not forward the order because of a battery or other issue?</strong></p>
                <p>A: Regardless of us warning people, some people have tried to use a freight forwarder to order boards and scooters.&nbsp; If your board or scooter gets rejected and returned to us, we will refund you - $200 / unit, to cover our shipping and rerouting fees. (Yes it costs us approximately $200 when your order gets rejected)</p>    
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Q: How about Alaska or Hawaii?</strong></p>
            <p>A: As much as we&nbsp;would like to ship to you,&nbsp;Fedex and UPS are very specific about our batteries traveling on airplanes so we can not ship to either of those states.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Q: What happens to me if I already own a Boosted Board with a warranty?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We are not Boosted Boards.&nbsp; Unfortunately Boosted went bankrupt and from what we've seen older warranty claims are being ignored.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Q: Then who are you guys?</strong></p>
            <p>A: We are the guys who bought all of the remaining inventory from Boosted after they shut their doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Q: What does that mean for me?&nbsp; Can I still get service for my Board / Rev?</strong></p>
            
            <p>A: We cannot honor warranties for items bought from Boosted because they are a different company.&nbsp; We can absolutely help you with service.&nbsp; If there is something that you need from us, belts, chargers, advice, please feel free to reach out to us:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sales@boostedusa.com">info@boostedusa.com</a>&nbsp;and we will do the best we can to respond to you ASAP.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <div>
                
            <p><b>Q: So if I have a warranty/repair issue with a board/scooter I already own I'm totally screwed?</b></p>
            <p>A: On the one hand, yes; when Boosted went bankrupt it appears that your claims to free replacements/repairs may have gone up in smoke.&nbsp; That being said, we understand the frustration you may feel and we want to do what we can to help.&nbsp; Email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@boostedusa.com">info@boostedusa.com</a>&nbsp;and let us know what's going on and we'll do our best to sort you out as fairly as possible, just remember that we are a different company and had nothing to do with your original purchase so if we don't hand you a new board please don't yell at us.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Q: If I buy something from you, what sort of warranty do I have?</strong></p>
            
            <p>A: We have a limited&nbsp;60 day warranty for everything you receive.&nbsp; This covers you for manufacturers defects out of the box. If you receive a product that you believe is defective please contact us immediately and do not use your product. Please include your serial number (if applicable) and a photo or video demonstrating the problem and email it to:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@boostedusa.com">info@boostedusa.com</a>. If we decide your issue needs inspection or replacement we will provide you with an RA number that must be attached to any items shipped back to us.</p>
            
            </div>
            
            <div><p><strong>Q: I need a replacement part that I don't see on your site.</strong></p>
                <p>A. That's not a question but you should know that we're continuing to receive boxes of goods and as we find items we will be adding them to our website for sale.&nbsp; Please keep an eye on the site in the coming weeks.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div><strong>Q. Will you be receiving more 105 wheels and/or Beams?</strong></div>
            <div>A. We hope so but again, we're unboxing products as fast as we can.&nbsp; We expect to see more of these items and we will add them to the site as soon as we do.&nbsp; In the meantime make sure to add your email to the "notify me" box and you'll get an email as soon as more stock is added.</div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>Q. I have an existing Boosted product with an issue.&nbsp; Can you help me repair it?</strong>
